# Computer-Programming-2-Final-Project

# Restaurant Management System

Our Restaurant Management System can be run and can be access through the terminal or also known as the console. Since we can input through the terminal and we do not include putting a GUI in our system, we can run it im the console without GUI's but only texts and through inputs.

In order to run

Restaurant Management System basing on the UML Class Diagram and since the class TestMain is not independent at all, so we created dependencies or classes to run the program. We created classes under the package of *RestaurantManagementSystem*, these classes are the class *Food*, *GuestOrder*, *ManageFood* and lastly class *TestMain*.

Through this classes, we also imported java utilitiy package which are the *java.util.Scanner* and *java.util.ArrayList* so that the user can make input at the console.
